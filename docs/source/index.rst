UtilityCode Documentation
=========================

UtilityCode is a suite of special utilities for software composition
analysis (SCA). These are primarily sandbox-style utilities to complement
the more robust tools available from AboutCode at:

    https://github.com/aboutcode-org

Over time many of these utilities will be incorporated into one or more
AboutCode projects.
