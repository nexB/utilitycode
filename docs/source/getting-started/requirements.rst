REQUIREMENTS
============
UtilityCode is tested with Python 3.7 or above only on Linux, Mac and
Windows. You will need to install a Python interpreter if you do not have
one already installed.

On Linux and Mac, Python is typically pre-installed. To verify which
version may be pre-installed, open a terminal and type:

    python --version

.. note::
    Debian has decided that distutils is not a core python package, so it is not included
    in the last versions of debian and debian-based OSes.

    A solution is to run: `sudo apt install python3-distutils`

On Windows or Mac, you can download the latest Python here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the .msi installer for Windows or the .dmg archive for Mac. Open
and run the installer using all the default options.
